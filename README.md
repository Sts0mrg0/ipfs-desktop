## IPFS Desktop Features

![IPFS Desktop](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbT2YtuNo17Qaq31FJWRZgRMY4E6N9cdfBwzZTFSHUoBP)

IPFS Desktop allows you to run your IPFS Node on your machine without having to bother with command line tools. With it, you have the power of [Web UI](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-webui) on tip of your hands plus a handful of shortcuts you can find on settings.

It's based on Web UI running in Electron to add those extra, awesome menu commands.

### IPFS daemon always running

IPFS Desktop's main feature is to allow you to have the IPFS daemon always running in the background. But fear not! If you need to stop it, you can do it just by clicking on 'Stop'.

### Handle `ipfs://`, `ipns://` and `dweb:` links

IPFS Desktop has the capacity to handle protocols at the operating system level; i.e., if an application tries to open a link to either `ipfs://`, `ipns://` or `dweb:`, then the OS will call IPFS Desktop, which will handle the link.

For example, if you come across a link on the Internet whose `href` attribute is `ipns://ipfs.io`, then IPFS Desktop will be able to handle it.

On Windows, an easy way to open a link would be to open the Run window (Win+R), paste the link, and hit Enter. Then, IPFS Desktop handles the rest. The same happens if you try opening the same link in a browser.

### Adds `ipfs` to your system

If you're using macOS or Windows and don't have `ipfs` installed on your system, IPFS Desktop will automatically install it so it is available through the command line. If you're using Linux, or already have `ipfs` installed, you can tell IPFS Desktop to take care of it (and keep it up to date!) by toggling the option on Settings.

### Easy add to IPFS

You can easily add files and folders to IPFS:

- On Windows, you can right click on files to add them to IPFS through IPFS Desktop.
- On macOS, you can drag and drop them to the tray icon.

### Download copied hashes

You can enable, on Settings, a shortcut to download an hash on the keyboard.

### Auto-add screenshots

You can enable, on Settings, a shortcut to take screenshots and add them automatically to IPFS.

Feel free to join in. All welcome. Open an [issue](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/issues)!

If you're interested in contributing translations, go to [project page on Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop/), create an account, pick a language and start translating.

This repository falls under the IPFS [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

### Translations

The translations are stored on [./assets/locales](./assets/locales) and the English version is the source of truth.
Other languages are periodically pulled from [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop/), a web interface to help us translate IPFS Desktop and its components to another languages.

### Releasing

- Manually test a few things that don't transfer well to automated testing:
     - Mac/Win/Linux: confirm that "Take Screenshot" under menubar/system tray menu works as expected for both single- and multi-monitor setups (file(s) imported, correct link copied to clipboard)
     - Mac only: drag/drop onto menubar icon behaves as expected when dragging one file, several files, and a combination of files/folders (file(s) imported, correct link copied to clipboard)
     - Win only: right-click on a file and "Add to IPFS" from context menu works as expected (file imported, correct link copied to clipboard)
     - Mac/Win: confirm that OS-wide protocol handler got registered by opening <a href="ipfs://bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi">`ipfs://bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi`</a> in user agent without IPFS Companion
- Fetch new translations from Transifex: `tx pull -a`
- Commit the changes
- Bump the version in `package.json`
- Commit the changes
- Create a tag with the same version: `git tag vA.B.C`
- Publish local changes and the tag to GitHub repo: `git push && git push origin vA.B.C`
- Wait for the CI to upload the binaries to the draft release (a new one will be created if you haven't drafted one).
- Publish release draft.
  - Once a release is published, users should receive the app update. See: https://www.electron.build/auto-update.
  - The `latest.yml, latest-mac.yml, latest-linux.yml` files on the release are used by the app to determine when an app update is available.
- Update links and badges in `README.md` to point to the new version (`A.B.C`)
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` with details from release/release draft
- Update selected package managers
  - Wait for CI to finish and confirm it updated [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/ipfs-desktop) and is at least pending review on [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/ipfs-desktop#versionhistory).
  - Update [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-a-cask).
- To start work on the next version, bump the version in the `package.json`

#### Manual notarization (Fallback in-case CI is not doing it correctly)

- Notarize `.dmg` at Apple (context: [#1365](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/issues/1211))
    1. Download `.dmg` from `https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/releases/vA.B.C`
    2. Ensure `APPLEID` and `APPLEIDPASS` are set either as environment variables or entries in `.env` file. Those need to belong to the same org as cert used for signing.
    3. Run `node pkgs/macos/notarize-cli.js ./IPFS-Desktop-A.B.C.dmg`
    4. Debug errors by calling the tool directly: `xcrun altool --notarize-app -f /path/to/IPFS-Desktop-0.X.0.dmg --primary-bundle-id io.ipfs.desktop -u XXX-from-vault-XXX -p XXX-app-specific-password-from-vault-XXX`, also see the [long list of hoops Apple might ask you to jump through](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/pull/1365#issuecomment-598127684).

## FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Where are my IPFS configuration and log files?

The configuration file and logs are located on:
- Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/IPFS Desktop/`
- Windows: `%appdata%/IPFS Desktop/`
- Linux: `~/.config/IPFS Desktop/`

For quick access to this folders, just right-click on your tray icon and then 'Logs Directory' or 'Configuration File', depending on what you want.

### How does IPFS Dekstop select the IPFS repo location?

We use [ipfsd-ctl](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfsd-ctl), which, in default conditions, will check `IPFS_PATH` environment variable. If not set, we fallback to `$HOME/.ipfs`. As soon as the first run has succeded, we save the information about the repository location in the configuration file, which becomes the source of truth.

### Which version of IPFS does IPFS Desktop run?

Since we're using [ipfsd-ctl](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfsd-ctl), we have our own embedded IPFS binary. We try to always have the latest version.

### Which flags does IPFS Desktop boot with?

By default we use the flags `--migrate=true --routing=dhtclient ----enable-gc=true` when running the IPFS daemon. They can be changed via the configuration file, which can be easily accessed as mentioned above.

### I don't have a system tray icon on Linux. Why?

Poor tray support is a long running problem with Electron apps: [electron/issues/21445](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/21445).  

According to [electron/v9.3.0/docs/api/tray.md](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/v9.3.0/docs/api/tray.md#class-tray):

* On Linux the app indicator will be used if it is supported, otherwise `GtkStatusIcon` will be used instead.
* On Linux distributions that only have app indicator support, you have to install `libappindicator1` to make the tray icon work.

Why the old tray is back since v0.13? We had no control over this: Electron team [removed support for `StatusNotifier` and restored the old tray interface on Linux called `XEmbed`](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/21445#issuecomment-634163402).

### I can't start IPFS Desktop under Debian 10. Why?

Some Linux users may see an error like this:

> The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly.
Rather than run without sandboxing I'm aborting now. You need to make sure that
chrome-sandbox is owned by root and has mode 4755.

or a very short one, when starting in a terminal:

```console
$ ipfs-desktop
$Trace/breakpoint trap
```

This is a known issue with Electron/Chrome and some hardened kernels.
If you are interested in details, read [this](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/issues/1362#issuecomment-596857282).

The only reliable way to fix this at the moment is to start the app with additional parameter:

```console
$ ipfs-desktop --no-sandbox
```
